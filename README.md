## DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT
currently just campbell's proof of concept script

add tweets to input.txt and run proof.py


### Running NLTK Proof of concept
```
make nltk
source nltk-env/bin/activate
python proof.py
```

### Running Indico Proof of concept
We have a limited number of calls for the month on the API key so unless
we want to start paying just don't run the proof of concept a billion times!

```
make indico
source indico/bin/activate
python indico-proof.py
```
